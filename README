Class-AutoClass

This is yet another module that generates standard 'get' and 'set'
methods for Perl classes.  It also handles initialization of object
and class data from parameter lists or defaults, and arranges for
object creation and initialization to occur in top-down, textbook
order even in the presence of multiple inheritance.

CAUTION: This module is old. We use it internally, and while it works
well for our purposes, we urge new users to heed the warnings in the
documentation.  This release brings the CPAN version of the module
up-to-date relative to our internal version, something we should have
done long ago.  We do not expect further releases of this code base,
except for bug fixes.  Future development, if any, will entail a
redesign building on newer CPAN modules.
